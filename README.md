# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Given no source code, created an interactive weather dashboard.  Using JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, CSS, HTML and Open Weather Map API, an interactive weather dashboard that uses user inputs renders current and forecasted weather.  Users enter a city into the text area and when the search button is clicked, the current weather and a 5-day forecast is populated with a UV index background indicator that matches the EPAs UV safety color warnings.  The dates and a weather icon are displayed to give a simple visual representation of the current and forecasted weather.  The cities users search, are stored in a list below the search field where users can select previously search cities and load the aforementioned weather criteria.  Users can also remove cities from their list by clicking on the 'X' button.  This page is mobile responsive which makes it easy to use on any device.

Ultimately, this is an easy-to-use weather app where users can search cities to find the local weather in that city and keep a list of previous cities that are able to be accessed again in the future at a click of a button, or, users can remove them at any time.
